# Calculator
This is my first project using Python. In this project, I am creating specific calculator programs, such as a matrix calculator and system of linear equations calculator.

The Calculator is made up of imported files. The files go in this order:

Calculator.py
  BasicOperations.py
  SLEcalc.py
    SLE2calc.py
    SLE3calc.py
    SLE4calc.py
  MatrixCalc.py
  DerivativeCalc.py
