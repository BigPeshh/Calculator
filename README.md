# Calculator
This is my first project using Python. In this project, I am creating specific calculator programs, such as a matrix calculator and system of linear equations calculator.
This would hopefully help you to get your calculations faster. This python project is easy and simple to use. Many of these calculators are very complex like algebra calculator and some are a piece of cake like the basic operations one.

The Calculator is made up of imported files. The files go in this order:

Calculator.py
	BasicOperations.py
	AdvancedOperations.py
	AlgebraCalc.py
		SLEcalc.py
			SLE2calc.py
			SLE3calc.py
			SLE4calc.py
		  MatrixCalc.py
	CalculusCalc.py
  		DerivativeCalc.py
		IntegralCalc.py
		LimitCalc.py
